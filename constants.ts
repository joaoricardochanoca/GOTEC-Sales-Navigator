## GOTEC Company Overview (2025)

### 1. Mission, Vision, and Value Proposition
- **Mission:** Transfer industrial technology with technical rigor, commercial neutrality, and a focus on ROI, positioning GOTEC as a strategic partner in the modernization of the molds, metalworking, and CNC subcontracting industry.
- **Value Proposition:** Technical-operational diagnosis → Ideal solution recommendation → ROI Analysis (Payback, VAL, TIR) → Installation and training → 360º Support (post-sales, maintenance, continuous improvement).

### 2. Target Market and Segments
- **Sectors:** Molds (injection), dies, automotive, aerospace, precision metalworking, composites.
- **Customer Profiles:** Toolmakers, mold makers, CNC subcontractors, OEM/Tier, prototyping units, and technical centers.
- **Critical Areas:** Dimensional precision, thermal stability, productivity/hour, repeatability, equipment availability (OEE).

### 3. Operational Structure (How We Work)
- **Commercial Methodology:** SPIN Selling, technical and economic qualification, BATNA, objection handling with production data.
- **Sales Process:** Technical discovery → Tech fit → Business case (ROI) → Proposal and trade-offs → Proof/technical visit → Closing → Onboarding.
- **Post-Sales:** Acceptance plan (SAT/FAT), training, maintenance plan, KPIs (OEE, scrap, cycle time), 30/90 day audit.
- **Tools:** CRM, technical dossiers per machine, ROI simulators, risk matrix, installation schedules.

### 4. Strategic Differentiation (The "Why Us")
- **Technical Impartiality:** Selection of the ideal machine, not just the "house" brand.
- **ROI Before CAPEX:** Every proposal is born from a business case (Payback/VAL/TIR).
- **360º Coverage:** From cutting to mold testing, including on-machine metrology.
- **HAMOO Integration:** Fast setup, in-cycle inspection, less scrap, and downtime.
- **Local Support:** Processes and documentation: SAT/FAT, training, and maintenance plans.

## GOTEC Production Process and Product Portfolio

### Process Flow
CORTE E PREPARAÇÃO (ZODEL) → FRESAGEM CNC (WEIDA) → TORNEAMENTO CNC (DONGS) → RETIFICAÇÃO CNC (HDCNC) → ELETROEROSÃO (HDCNC/NOVICK) → VERIFICAÇÃO / MEDIÇÃO (HAMOO) → INJEÇÃO PLÁSTICA (CHEN HSONG)

### 1. CORTE E PREPARAÇÃO DE MATERIAL (ZODEL)
- **Objective:** Prepare bars, blocks, and metal profiles with precision, speed, and safety.
- **Equipment:** Automatic and semi-automatic CNC saws (GD / GZK series), roller tables, automatic feeding systems.
- **Technical Arguments:** Cutting precision ±0.2 mm, preparation time reduction up to 60%, ROI < 10 months, rigid structure and long durability.
- **Key Selling Point:** ZODEL is the solid foundation of modern CNC production.

### 2. FRESAGEM CNC (WEIDA)
- **Objective:** Transform raw material into complex geometries with precision and repeatability, maximizing productivity.
- **Equipment:** Vertical machining centers (GMILL), horizontal (HMC), gantry and 5-axis simultaneous (GMC / DMC).
- **Technical Arguments:** Monoblock structure and refrigerated spindles, tool change in <2.5 s, load capacity up to 8t, CAM Estimator compatibility.
- **Key Selling Point:** WEIDA offers precision and productivity with measurable returns. Migration from 3 to 5 axes for "done-in-one" production is a key argument.

### 3. TORNEAMENTO CNC (DONGS)
- **Objective:** Machine cylindrical parts and large components with power, stability, and total control.
- **Equipment:** Vertical turning centers (VTC Series), horizontal and multitasking (HTC / CK Series).
- **Technical Arguments:** High rigidity cast iron structure, high torque (up to 45 kW), BMT motorized turret and C-axis, turning diameters up to Ø1600 mm, cycle reduction up to 40%.
- **Key Selling Point:** DONGS means power and precision in motion. Argue for setup reduction with multitasking (motorized tools, Y-axis).

### 4. RETIFICAÇÃO CNC (HDCNC)
- **Objective:** Ensure superficial finishing and final geometric accuracy, achieving micrometric tolerances.
- **Equipment:** CNC surface, cylindrical, and internal grinders (M71, MKS, SGA series).
- **Technical Arguments:** Roughness Ra < 0.2 µm, hydrostatic guides and stabilized casting, automatic cooling and lubrication system. Ideal for molds, inserts, and precision components.
- **Key Selling Point:** HDCNC is precision that defines the final quality standard.

### 5. ELETROEROSÃO (EDM) (HDCNC / NOVICK)
- **Objective:** Machine cavities, inserts, and profiles impossible by milling, with extreme precision and total control of electrical discharge.
- **Equipment:** Wire EDM, Sinker EDM, Drill EDM.
- **Technical Arguments (NOVICK):** Benchmark against premium brands. Focus on mirror finish (Ra ≤ 0.15 μm) and ROI. Precision up to ±0.003 mm, complex geometries without mechanical stress, reduction of electrode wear.
- **Key Selling Point:** The detail that transforms precision into art.

### 6. INJEÇÃO DE PLÁSTICO (CHEN HSONG)
- **Objective:** Convert high-precision molds into real production, ensuring fast cycles, repeatability, and energy efficiency.
- **Equipment:** Servo-hydraulic machines (SM / JM / MK6 Series), hybrid and electric injection systems, closing units from 60 to 6500 t.
- **Technical Arguments:** Up to 50% lower energy consumption thanks to ServoDrive, injection precision ±0.1 g and guaranteed thermal stability, iChen™ Dashboard interface with real-time monitoring, ROI < 18 months.
- **Key Selling Point:** Efficiency, precision, and connectivity in industrial injection. Argue for an energy-saving audit.

### 7. VERIFICAÇÃO E MEDIÇÃO (HAMOO)
- **Objective:** Integrate dimensional control directly on the CNC machine, automating measurement and eliminating human errors.
- **Equipment:** Touch probes, non-contact optical probes, laser systems for tool measurement and breakage detection.
- **Technical Arguments:** Setup reduction up to 40%, micrometric repeatability, automatic deviation compensation, universal compatibility (Fanuc, Siemens, etc.), ROI < 6 months with elimination of scrap and unplanned downtime.
- **Key Selling Point:** HAMOO provides automatic precision at the heart of the CNC process. Focus on the "Cost of Non-Quality".

### 8. SUPORTE E INTEGRAÇÃO GOTEC
- **Objective:** Ensure each client receives an optimized, profitable CNC solution adapted to their production flow.
- **Services:** Free technical-operational diagnosis, ROI and Payback calculation based on real data, recommendation of the ideal solution (neutral and impartial), installation, training, and preventive maintenance.
